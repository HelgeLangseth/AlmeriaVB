## About the files in this folder:

* Most files come in pairs, named `students_<X>`and `solution_<X>`. 
The `students_<X>`files were handed out as coding exercises in class, 
while the accompanying `solution_<X>`-files are the solutions to theses "challenges". 
* A few files do not follow this naming-regime. These are code-examples used during Lecture 5 (Edward examples, and so on)
