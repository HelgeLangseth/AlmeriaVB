## About the files in this folder:

* Most files come in pairs, named `student_<X>`and `solution_X`. 
The `student_<X>`files are handed out as coding exercises in class, 
while the accompanying `solution_<X>`-files are the solutions to theses "challenges". 
* A few files do not follow this naming-regime. These are code-examples used during Lecture 5 (Edward examples, and so on)
